- 👋 Hi, I’m @Maker1620
- 👀 I’m interested in drones, CAD, GIS, and of course my doggo who I take in the woods to enjoy some time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning via the "Data Scientist" path on Codecademy, where I have also completed the JavaScript and SQL courses.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building some workflows to help disect the data collected by drones in exterior applications.  
- 📫 How to reach me: for now I would say message me here?  I don't know, actually, I probably wouldn't communicate yet with folks on here, you guys are all waaaay
smarter than me, I imagine at this junction I would only be asking stupid questions and not bringing much value to anything you're doing.
